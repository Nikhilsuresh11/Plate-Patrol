# Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using OpenCV and Camera

## Overview

This project is an Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system implemented using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, and a camera. The system is designed to automatically detect license plates in images or video streams captured by the camera and extract the alphanumeric characters for further processing.

## Features

- **License Plate Detection:** Automatically detect license plates in images or video streams.
- **Character Segmentation:** Segment the alphanumeric characters from the detected license plates.
- **Character Recognition:** Recognize and extract the alphanumeric characters from the segmented regions.
- **Real-time Processing:** Perform ANPR in real-time using a connected camera.
- **Python Interface:** Capture images in real-time using the camera and process them for ANPR.

## Installation

To set up this ANPR system, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including OpenCV and Jupyter Notebook (for notebook version).

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook Version

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`ANPR-tutorial.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Ensure your camera is connected to your system.
3. Follow the instructions and run each cell in the notebook to start the ANPR system.
4. The system will begin processing the video stream from the camera, detecting license plates, and recognizing the characters.

### Python Interface Version

1. Run the Python script (`app.py`) using the following command:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

2. Ensure your camera is connected to your system.
3. The script will start capturing images in real-time from the camera and process them for ANPR.

## Configuration

- **Camera Settings:** Adjust camera parameters such as resolution, frame rate, etc., in the notebook or Python script as needed.
- **Character Recognition Model:** Train or fine-tune the character recognition model for better accuracy.
